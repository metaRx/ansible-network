# This lists a bunch of experimental thoughts and features

* for `cl_img_install` use binary files available to look into new file to
 determine code version. frees up user from defining code version or module
guessing code from filename. Problem is that file must be reside on filesystem
to do this. So does this mean file must be always found on local filesystem
before module works?
